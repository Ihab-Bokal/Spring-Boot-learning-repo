- This package was created to see the error that Spring Boot throws when it can't find the specified components
in the main packages -> It can't parse the package to find the beans -> it can't add them to Spring container
To manage them. Hence, resulting in the error

- Unless explicitly indicated in the IoCAndDiApplication class - i.e. the main class - The app won't scan this
package

- The error that the compiler throws after moving ICoach and CricketCoach to this Ã¢ckage is:
Consider defining a bean of type 'com.IoC.and.DependencyInjection.IoCAndDI.common.ICoach'
in your configuration

- The remedy to this problem is by adding the following parameter to @SpringBootApplication:
@SpringBootApplication(
		// This parameter tells Spring Boot the packages where it should look for components
		scanBasePackages = {
				"com.IoC.and.DependencyInjection.testingComponentScanErrors",
				"com.IoC.and.DependencyInjection.IoCAndDI"
		})
